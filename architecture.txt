basic 2d top down game. Essentially no physics will be used in this demo.
All I'm trying to do is create a functional model of a game which has
online multiplayer, where users can control their character, and have
those movements show up on everyone else's screens within a reasonable
time buffer.

We'll use a client-server model, probably with one of the clients
"hosting" the game, acting as both client and server.

Since the game isn't based on "states", we will be using UDP. We will send
movement of other players every tick, and recieve such data once again,
every tick. We will also refresh all the states every few ticks, perhaps once every 300 ticks we reset the locations.
