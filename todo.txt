To Do:

- add reading and writing to both client and server

- add time, so that they can act based on ticks

- both client and server will read continously, but only send once per tick
	(this is because connection issues can make messages not necessarily be
	recieved exactly on the tick mark, so you need to just be prepared to read
	them whenever they are ready.)

- create some kind of data the client can continously send, and the server can
	relay it over to all other clients, and vice versa for every other client
	as well.

- create a "phone book" so that the server can know who's who, and send data to
	everyone (UDP is connectionless). It also allows the server to tell the
	other clients who the message came from, as well as prove that clients
	aren't faking messages as if they are a different client.

- Test it! Get a working basic model just in the terminal. Once that works, try
	it in Unity (after doing some C# scripting to create a client).
